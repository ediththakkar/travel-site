site for tourism, and travel abroad 
my personal webpage project

### Milestone 1 Feedback
Overall this is a great direction for PWP - to promote a business venture which is a travel and tourism company that you own/run - but I'm afraid that based on what I'm reading here your ideas may be outside of scope. Keep in mind that PWP is a single page, **static** website only. There will be no back-end to this project (aside from the very simple contact form). There will be no database, data design, or application layer in this project - thus no account creation or "logging in" or trip booking. Based on your Persona, it sounds like Joan wants to log in and book a vacation on your site - this is way way way far outside of the scope of what can be achieved in this class. Please review the PWP Overview for full details on the scope of this assignment, and please contact me via Slack if you have any questions. Also refer to the PWP Gallery for some examples of the scope of this project as well.

What you can definitely achieve here is create a simple one-page site to promote your business, and use the contact form to facilitate customer contact. **Before starting Milestone 2a, please outline your Purpose, Audience, Goal(s) and Persona to detail the direction for your project to fall within scope. Please let me know ASAP when revisions are in place.**

Your project is all set up to spec, but there are some problems with your code. Please see Edits &amp; Suggestions below for more details.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/), but please submit revisions before beginning work on Milestone 2&alpha;.

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Your `<head>` tag is not closed properly - and should be closed just below line 5, not on line 24.
- Watch your indentation - it's off.
- Line 13: This `<img>` tag should link to an image file, not milestone-1.php.
